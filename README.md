**Overview:**

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model, specifically distilbert-base-uncased, for text classification using the IMDB dataset. The task is to classify movie reviews into two categories: Positive and Negative. Additionally, the fine-tuning process is accelerated by leveraging LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient transfer learning method, using the peft library.

**The project covers the following steps:**

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.

Tokenizing the text data.

Loading and fine-tuning the pre-trained DistilBERT model.

Applying LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

Training and evaluating the model.

Making predictions on unseen examples.


**Dataset:**
The dataset used is a truncated version of the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews split evenly between positive and negative sentiment.

**Labels:**
0: Negative
1: Positive
You can load the dataset as follows:

**Model:**
We use the distilbert-base-uncased model, which is a smaller and faster version of BERT. For text classification, we modify the output head to predict two classes: Positive and Negative.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is applied to fine-tune only certain layers of the model, reducing the number of trainable parameters and making the training process more efficient. The target modules include parts of the attention mechanism (q_lin).

**Tokenization:**
We use the AutoTokenizer from Hugging Face's transformers library. If the tokenizer does not have a pad token, we add one.

The tokenize_function truncates the input text to a maximum of 512 tokens and tokenizes it



**target_modules:** Specifies which modules to fine-tune, in this case, the query linear layers of the attention mechanism (q_lin).

**Training:**
We use Hugging Face's Trainer class to train the model. The training arguments include the learning rate, batch size, and evaluation strategy:
The model is trained on the tokenized dataset using the train() method of the Trainer class.
To evaluate the model, we use the accuracy metric from the evaluate library. After the training process, the model can make predictions on unseen data:

**Before training:** The model produces random predictions.

**After training:** The model correctly classifies most positive and negative sentiments in the test examples.

**Customization:**
You can easily switch the model from distilbert-base-uncased to other models like roberta-base by changing the model_checkpoint.
Experiment with other datasets by adjusting the load_dataset() function.
LoRA parameters can be adjusted based on the dataset size and complexity.

**Conclusion:**
This project illustrates how to fine-tune transformer models efficiently using LoRA for sentiment analysis. By utilizing a smaller model (DistilBERT) and parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA), it achieves faster training with fewer resources while maintaining good performance for binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
