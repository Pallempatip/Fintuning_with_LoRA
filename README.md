**Overview:**

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model, specifically distilbert-base-uncased, for text classification using the IMDB dataset. The task is to classify movie reviews into two categories: Positive and Negative. Additionally, the fine-tuning process is accelerated by leveraging LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient transfer learning method, using the peft library.

The project covers the following steps:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset
Tokenizing the text data
Loading and fine-tuning the pre-trained DistilBERT model
Applying LoRA for efficient fine-tuning
Training and evaluating the model
Making predictions on unseen examples.
Dependencies

**Dataset:**
The dataset used is a truncated version of the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews split evenly between positive and negative sentiment.

Labels:
0: Negative
1: Positive
You can load the dataset as follows:

**Model:**
We use the distilbert-base-uncased model, which is a smaller and faster version of BERT. For text classification, we modify the output head to predict two classes: Positive and Negative.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is applied to fine-tune only certain layers of the model, reducing the number of trainable parameters and making the training process more efficient. The target modules include parts of the attention mechanism (q_lin).

**Tokenization:**
We use the AutoTokenizer from Hugging Face's transformers library. If the tokenizer does not have a pad token, we add one.

The tokenize_function truncates the input text to a maximum of 512 tokens and tokenizes it:


LoRA Configuration
The LoRA configuration is set up as follows:

python
Copy code
peft_config = LoraConfig(task_type="SEQ_CLS", r=4, lora_alpha=32, lora_dropout=0.01, target_modules=['q_lin'])
model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)
r: The rank of the low-rank decomposition
lora_alpha: Scaling factor for LoRA
lora_dropout: Dropout applied to the LoRA layers
target_modules: Specifies which modules to fine-tune, in this case, the query linear layers of the attention mechanism (q_lin).
Training
We use Hugging Face's Trainer class to train the model. The training arguments include the learning rate, batch size, and evaluation strategy:

python
Copy code
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=model_checkpoint + "-lora-text-classification",
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=10,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
)
The model is trained on the tokenized dataset using the train() method of the Trainer class:

python
Copy code
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["validation"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)
trainer.train()
Evaluation
To evaluate the model, we use the accuracy metric from the evaluate library. After the training process, the model can make predictions on unseen data:

python
Copy code
text_list = ["It was good.", "Not a fan, don't recommend.", "Better than the first one.", "This is not worth watching even once.", "This one is a pass."]
for text in text_list:
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors="pt")
    inputs = inputs.to(model.device)
    logits = model(inputs).logits
    predictions = torch.argmax(logits, 1)
    print(text + " - " + id2label[predictions.tolist()[0]])
Results
Before training: The model produces random predictions.
After training: The model correctly classifies most positive and negative sentiments in the test examples.
Customization
You can easily switch the model from distilbert-base-uncased to other models like roberta-base by changing the model_checkpoint.
Experiment with other datasets by adjusting the load_dataset() function.
LoRA parameters can be adjusted based on the dataset size and complexity.
Conclusion
This project illustrates how to fine-tune transformer models efficiently using LoRA for sentiment analysis. By utilizing a smaller model (DistilBERT) and parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA), it achieves faster training with fewer resources while maintaining good performance for binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
